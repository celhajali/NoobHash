# NoobHash

Disclaimer: This project is my attempt at creating a very limited version of a hash table after doing research on hash tables for 10 minutes. The following code is not representative of a perfect hash table. If you are a hash table and this does not represent you in a bright light, I deeply apologize.

The functions provided allow you to initialize a hash table, add key/value pairs to a table, and find a value based on a key that you provide.
NOTE: Only strings can be used as keys and values.

The tests performed in main.c demonstrate that more than one key/value pair can be associated with a single index in the table. It also demonstrates that key values can be updated without changing other items in the table. The second test demonstrates that the values of key1-key11 were changed and that key12-key15 were not affected.
